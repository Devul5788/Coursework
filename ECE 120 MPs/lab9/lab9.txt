QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The program first clears the contents of R2 by sign extending 0 to 16 bits. After this the program modifies the contents of R2 by setting it to 12. This is done by essentially adding #12 to #0. After this the trap vector x25 is used to halt the program.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program allows us to look at what is happening at each specific step and to see exactly where something is wrong. As mentioned in the question it is often quite difficult to identify what is causing a specific bug. By going through each step of a program and seeing how the computer is interpretting certain instructions gives makes it much easier to identify a bug in the code.
