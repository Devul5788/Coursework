<h1>Team Contract (sg49-ambala2-danahar2)</h1>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Team Meeting</b>: We will meet twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays after our 225 lecture. Our roles for each meeting would be that of the scribe, analyst and skeptic. The analyst would be resposible for introducing new ideas/code to the group, and the skeptic will be responsible for providing criticism and alternate ideas. The scribe would be responsible for logging in the information and maintaining the DEVELOPMENT LOG. These roles will rotate every session. The meetings are always at 3:00 pm and will either happen at Zoom or in-person.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Assistance</b>: Our main line of communication is the final project Discord that we have made. Other lines of communication
    are WhatsApp and text message. Team members are expected to respond latest in 24 hours after receiving any message.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Respect</b>: We will strive to make sure each team member has a platform to share their ideas and opinions to the group free of judgement. The anayst would be the one introducing a majority of new ideas every sessions, and it is the resposibility of the other members to actively engage in the disscussion and provide constructive criticism. This is how we get every member to speak their mind and share ideas. The skeptic is resposibly for providing feedback, and the scribe must mediate the discussion.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Work Distribution</b>: The first session of every weeks would involve looking at the status of our project
    and creating a to-do list for the week. Next, we will split the tasks based on competency and interest of each
    of the members, ensuring an equal distribution of word load. In case of any complications arising, we will vote on an issue since we have an odd number of members. We will ensure that work is distributed equitably according to skill and interest.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Time Commitment</b>: We are all expected to indivdually dedicating in 2 to 6 hours every week for the final project. In the first section of each week during planning, each member is expected to layout a rough and timelime for when they would complete each task specified by the to-do list.<br>
    When time conflicts inevitably arise, we want to ensure that members inform about this well in advanced. We will require a 24 hour notice for absence in the weekly meeting except in the case of an emergency. In addition to this, every member is also responsible for making-up for their absence. We all will be understanding and cooperative, but after multiple instances of misconduct or disinterest bring issue up with our project mentor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Conflict</b>: As mentioned earlier, since we have an odd number of members all issues will be resolved by voting. After the vote has been taken, even the losing party must show interest and dedication in the work. If a team member is habitually late, we will first politely request the team member to be more punctual. Failure to do so will result in us reporting the member to the project mentor after warning. Another hypothetical situation is finishing work during the Fall break, where we have decided to convene every alternate day over zoom in order to get ahead on project work.
